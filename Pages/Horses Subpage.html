The horse is an odd toed ungulate mammal which means an animal with rear hooves and an odd amount of toes. It is one of the two subspecies of Equus Ferus and belongs to the taxonomic Equidae family. The first horses were domesticated by mankind around 4000 years ago by some nomads and were essential to a majority of human societies before the engine was created. There is one species of domestic horse but they have been bred to do different tasks which reach up to 400 different breeds. There are many feral horses as well and they can be found all over the world. Horses travel in groups with a stallion as the alpha male and the rest of the group consists of females and the young which are called foals. Once the males are around the age of two, they are kicked out of the herd and travel with other young males to find some females for themselves. Horses have been around for over 10’s of millions of years and have adapted to fit their environment with well-developed balance and a strong fight or flight response. It is rare to see a horse lying down and they do not do it often and they can even sleep whilst standing up. Horses move naturally on a four-beat walk and an average of 6.4Km an hour, two-beat trot at 13-19 Km and hour, three-beat gait at 19-24Km an hour and a gallop at 40-48 Km and hour with the fastest horse going at 88 Km an hour. Horses are known as a prey animal and that is why their speed is so fast and their fight or flight response so strong.
