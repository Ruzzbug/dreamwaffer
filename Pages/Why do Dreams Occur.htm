 <h2 class="heading">Why do dreams occur?</h2>

<p>

There is no scientifically proven understanding of why dreams occur, but there are many theories. Experts believe that dreams can aid in memory consolidation, and your ability to remember things. Other people believe that dreams are for emotion regulation. Other theories include threat simulation and preparing yourself for other things that occur in your life, which is where another theory comes in, that dreams are for processing the past, present and planning for the future, and a simulation of our lives while we sleep. Three more simple theories are that dreams are a result of other things that are going on in our brain while we are sleeping, the section of your brain that receives images is sleeping but the section that interprets images is still awake and interprets things a bit incorrect, and that they are just a result of chemical processes that occur in our brain during sleep.

Those processes can include electrical impulses that pull various memories and images and then display them while you are sleeping in an often strange or exciting way, and in a recent study, researchers found that four different electrical brain waves travel through your brain while you are sleeping, named Alpha, Beta, Delta and Theta. Each wave goes at a different speed, and come together to form the electroencephalography, which is called the EEG for short. The lower the amount of Theta waves in the frontal lobes of your brain, the more likely you are to remember your dreams.
